The following are items that need further work:
- Data Model:
 - Handle diffs for the Firebug free edit modes (HTML free edit is complete)
 - Implement more complex diffing on insert and remove. I.e. expand insert and remove
    combinations into distinct changes within the data rather than 2 events.
- CSS Changes merged with editor changes due to "race" condition
- Application-level CSS Changes
- Sheet-level CSS events (Insert/Remove due to DOM event modification)
- Diff Monitor
 - CSS Rep Links
- Diff + Snapshot with CSS changes on inline stylesheets
- Remove Firebug objects from snapshots + diff
